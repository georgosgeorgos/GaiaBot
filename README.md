## THE ISSUE

Communication in the workplace can get overwhelmingly complicated. Reminders and questions get repetitive, group chats ignored, people hard to find, and schedules mixed up. Currently there are numerous corporate platforms and chats in the market, but they do not provide a centralized, smart interactive system. Technologies that are supposed to make communication easy and quick often just complicate it.

We created Gaia, an intelligent chat bot that will become the center of internal communication for your company. It makes information exchange fast and easy, handling and automating tedious tasks. All integrated seamlessly on Telegram, powered by Microsoft Graph API, api.ai, Telepot, and lots of coffee
